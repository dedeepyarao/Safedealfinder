The selected model of e-commerce is an online price comparator with increased emphasis on 
security. The platform is highly relevant in the present online world, where phishing scams and 
bogus websites are principal threats to buyers. Our system offers a safe online shopping experience 
by incorporating phishing detection and link checking before price comparison. Security measures 
such as multifactor authentication (MFA) and encrypted transactions will be utilized to protect 
users' credentials and payment data. The project is an ideal case study for the implementation of 
secure e-commerce design, especially with online pharmacies where customers' sensitive data and 
financial information require top-grade encryption standards
